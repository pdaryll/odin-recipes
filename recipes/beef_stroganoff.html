        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>

        <li>8 ounces (225g) white mushrooms, sliced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup (240ml) beef broth</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (120ml) sour cream</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)</li>
        <li>8 ounces (225g) egg noodles or rice (for serving)</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Add the sliced beef and cook until browned. Remove the beef from the skillet and set it aside.</li>
        <li>In the same skillet, add chopped onion and cook until it becomes translucent.</li>
        <li>Add minced garlic and sliced mushrooms, then saut√© until the mushrooms are tender and any liquid has evaporated.</li>

        <li>Pour in the beef broth, Worcestershire sauce, and Dijon mustard. Stir and let the mixture simmer until it thickens.</li>
        <li>Return the cooked beef to the skillet and simmer until it's heated through and the sauce is thickened to your liking.</li>
        <li>Stir in the sour cream and cook for a few more minutes, but do not let it boil.</li>
        <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Serve the beef stroganoff over cooked egg noodles or rice.</li>
        <li>Garnish with chopped fresh parsley before serving.</li>
