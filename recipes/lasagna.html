    <p>This lasagna recipe takes a little work, but it is so satisfying and filling that it's worth it!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Meat: This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.</li>
        <li>Tomato products: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</li>
        <li>Sugar: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</li>
        <li>Spices and seasonings: This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Lasagna noodles: Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</li>
        <li>Cheeses: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</li>
        <li>Egg: An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>Boil a large pot of water and cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add diced onions and minced garlic, and sauté until they become translucent.</li>
        <li>Add ground beef or ground Italian sausage to the skillet and cook until it's browned and cooked through. Break it into small pieces with a spoon as it cooks.</li>
        <li>Stir in canned crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and seasonings (such as salt, pepper, Italian seasoning, and sugar). Simmer the sauce for about 10-15 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, mix together ricotta cheese, egg, chopped fresh basil, and grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>In a large baking dish, layer the ingredients in the following order:
          <ol>
            <li>A thin layer of meat sauce</li>
            <li>Lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>Ricotta cheese mixture</li>
            <li>Shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Repeat the layers until you've used up all your ingredients, finishing with a layer of meat sauce and a generous sprinkling of mozzarella cheese on top.</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes until the lasagna is bubbly and the cheese is golden and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Let the lasagna rest for about 10 minutes before serving to allow it to set. Enjoy your homemade lasagna!</li>
      </ol>
